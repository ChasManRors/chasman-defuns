Create an Invoice from your Pomodoros

There is a program called Vitamin-R which manages Pomodoros 

You can create invoices from these pomodoros if you use Vitamin-R, Emacs, Ruby and a spreadsheet.

See youtube video on how to do this http://www.youtube.com/cmmagid

I assume you can visit the vitamin-r.el file and do a M-x eval-current-buffer to get the functions defined in your emacs.

contact me with questions.
